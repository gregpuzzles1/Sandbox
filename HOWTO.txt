TAMOGEN: Tone Altering Mosaic Generator
#######################################

TAMOGEN is a program designed to either create a mosaic of one image out of another,
or create a mosaic of one image out of itself. 

The images used can be color or black and white.  At runtime, TAMOGEN will allow you to convert
color images to a black and white mosaic if so desired.

TAMOGEN will allow you to specify how many times the smaller image is repeated to create the
larger mosaic.  It will do this by asking you how many columns, and how many rows you would like
to have. If you specify 40 rows and 40 columns, the resulting mosaic will repeat the smaller 
image 1600 times.  

Bear in mind that this effectively is the resolution at which the larger image will be seen.

10 columns and 10 rows will create an almost unrecognizable large image with easy to see small 
images.  200 columns by 200 columns will create a very clear larger image, but the smaller images
will be harder to see.

TAMOGEN will also allow you to specify the resulting pixel resolution of the image.  The higher
the final resolution, the larger the image will print and the clearer the smaller images will be
when viewed at full size.  

You can also find and edit the python source code in the file "tamogensrc.py". To do 

#######################################

To run TAMOGEN:

1. Unzip the files in tamogen.zip to your computer. 

2. Copy the image(s) you wish to use to the same directory as TAMOGEN.  

3. Run the program by double-clicking "tamogen.exe"

4. Answer the questions asked

5. In the last question, you will be asked what the mosaic file name will be.
The final picture file will be named: <name you specified>.final.png

6. After running TAMOGEN, you will find an image named <something>.thumbnail.PNG - 
you can delete that.


**NOTE: THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES THAT YOU USE .PNG IMAGES FOR THE TIME BEING. A FUTURE UPDATE WILL
SUPPORT ADDITIONAL FORMATS.

You can also find and edit the python source code in the file "tamogensrc.py". To do so, you will need
a working installation of Python on your machine and the Python Imaging Library (PIL) installed.
