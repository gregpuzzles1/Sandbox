# Sandbox

This repository is a personal sandbox for Python experiments, test files, and various programming projects. It contains a wide array of scripts, sample programs, and other resources accumulated over time, most of which are written in Python. The structure and content reflect explorations, coding practice, and solution prototypes for different problems and topics.

## Purpose

- Experiment with Python code and libraries
- Test programming concepts and features
- Develop demo programs for practice or teaching
- Serve as a scratchpad for random programming and computational ideas

## Contents

Some examples of what's inside:

- Python scripts for algorithms, puzzles, games, GUI, and audio
- Small experiments (e.g., Hello World, GUI demos, fractals)
- Utility scripts (e.g., finite state machines, file stats)
- Demos for libraries or modules (tkinter, pygame, PyQt, smtplib)
- Study/test files and assorted documentation (.txt, .docx)
- Image, audio, and other binary resources generated by scripts

### Sample Files (not exhaustive)

- [`hello_world.py`](hello_world.py): The classic Hello World script.
- [`GUIexample.py`](GUIexample.py): Example with Python GUI elements.
- [`complex_polynomial_roots_fractal.py`](complex_polynomial_roots_fractal.py) and associated images.
- [`Simple_Finite_State_Machine_class.py`](Simple_Finite_State_Machine_class.py): State machine implementation.
- [`dice_game_1.py`](dice_game_1.py), [`dice_game_2.py`](dice_game_2.py): Simple dice games.
- [`test.py`](test.py), [`test1.py`](test1.py): Test scripts.
- [`flowers.py`](flowers.py), [`flowers-loop.py`](flowers-loop.py): Computational drawing.
- Many more scripts for practice problems, python idioms, and teaching resources.

## Usage

Feel free to browse, experiment, and adapt the code for your own educational or experimental purposes. Since this is a sandbox, code quality and documentation are casual and sometimes inconsistent.
