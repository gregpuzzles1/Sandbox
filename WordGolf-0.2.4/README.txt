Word Golf
---------

An addictive word game based on a combination of the word game Boggle and golf.

You play a series of holes and try to combine words with enough letters to make
it to the hole. Each hole has a par so try to use as few words as possible.

On the harder levels, stay away from bunkers and water traps to avoid penalty strokes.

Requires: Python 2.6+ and pygame 1.9+


To run the game:

    python wordgolf.py

Thanks for playing!
