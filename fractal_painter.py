# PREAMBLE



# My original intention was to create some

# disruptive visual camoflage, inspired by the pattern on

# the bark of plane trees. The result was never quite what I intended

# and several fixes had to be incorperated to aproximate what I wanted.

# The end result is effective though and reminds me of a Jackson Pollock

# or a Monet painting.

# I think that the program does quite a good job of producing an aesteticalty

# pleasing picture, through a purely mathematical process,

# though some considerable tweeking on the part of the programmer

# was needed to achieve this.

# In this version, I am able to show a wide variety of colour schemes.

# Artists code their colours according to three dimensions, (hue, chorma and saturation)

# This might be a more apropriate approach than (red, green, blue).
